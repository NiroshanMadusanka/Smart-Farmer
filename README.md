# 🌾 Smart Farmer: A Direct Farmer-to-Customer Marketplace

## 📌 Project Overview

Smart Farmer is a mobile application designed to bridge the gap between small-scale farmers and customers. By removing middlemen, the platform allows farmers to list their products and customers to purchase fresh produce directly at fair prices. The app uses bank slip verification for payments and fosters direct communication between users.
